        Hello! I’m Gauri Gawade, a passionate Java Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development. I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Civil Engineering from Vidya Pratishthan’s Kamal Nayan Bajaj Institute of Baramati, where I achieved a CGPA of 9.6. With 2 years of experience at Paytm as a Full Stack Developer, I have gained extensive expertise in the FinTech domain, working on the iPay project.

I specialize in Java, Advanced Java, Spring Framework, and have hands-on experience with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. My work involves developing and optimizing web applications that provide seamless user experiences, and I thrive on solving complex problems with efficient solutions. I'm always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest technologies to drive innovation and growth.
